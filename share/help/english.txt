           <BOLD>Introduction</BOLD>

           TPDA - Query Repository Tool' is a utility programme
           destined to export data from a relational database
           to Microsoft Excel proprietary format or in the open
           document format (ODF), used by OpenOffice or LibreOffice Calc.
           Also the CSV format is supported.

           It's very simple to use this application, select a report
           title from the list and click on the 'Run' toolbar button
           (symbol: blue arrow to the right).

           If all is right, the required file should be generated in the
           configured output directory.

           <BOLD>Warning</BOLD> generating reports in ODF format may take
           longer than you expect, something like 100 record in 10 minutes.
