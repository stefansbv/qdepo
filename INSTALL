TPDA - Query Repository Tool - a wxPerl GUI tool for data exporting
and query repository management. Queries are saved in XML files and

Current supported export formats: CSV, Excel, OpenOffice Calc.
Database management systems support: Firebird, PostgreSQL MySQL and
SQLite.


% tar -xvzf Qrt-0.10.tar.gz

or

% unzip  Qrt-0.10.zip

cd Qrt-0.10


QUICK start

perl dev.pl


INSTALL

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

Only make install should be run as root


IMPORTANT

If 'make test' is skipped, than, run 'tpda-qrt' from the package
directory first.  This will create the configuration tree in the users
$HOME path, by copying the files found in the Qrt-0.10/share
directory.

% tpda-qrt test


USAGE

Create a new connection configuration, let's name it 'myconn':

% tpda-qrt -i myconn

Edit $HOME/.tpda_qrt/db/myconn/etc/connection.yml

For 'driver', following options are valid:

firebird
postgresql
mysql
sqlite

case is not important

'output' is the path where the files are generated.

Start the program with:

% tpda-qrt myconn [-u username -p password]

no login screen yet ...

Click on the '+' toolbar button and then on the 'Edit' button, edit
the title, the output file name, (the sheet name is valid only for
Excel type output) and the description.

In the Parameters Tab input a description and a value for a parameter,
for example for a 'employee' table:

'Salary' '100000'

Delete all other description and values on other rows.

Edit the SQL text, example:

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary < value1 AND salary IS NOT NULL;

Save, then select a file output type between 'Calc', 'CSV' or 'Excel'
click on the connect button and than on 'Run'.  A new file, filled
with appropriate data, should have been created on the 'output' path.

I'd like some feedback from you, if you tried to install and succeeded
or failed, than please, contact me at <stefansbv 'at' users
. sourceforge . net>.  Of course, a more or less detailed explanation
of what you like or dislike would be helpful for the future
development of this project.

Have fun!
