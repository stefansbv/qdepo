TPDA - Query Repository Tool - A desktop application for retrieving
and exporting data from relational database systems to spreadsheet
files.

Please, read the Disclaimer of Warranty. from the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE.

This is a Perl application with wxPerl and/or PerlTk graphical user
interface. Unpack the distribution file, install the prerequisites
listed in Makefile.PL,

 % cpanm --installdeps .  # easy if you have App::cpanminus installed

Than install like any other standard Perl module:

 % tar xaf Tpda-Qrt-0.XX.tar.gz
 % cd Tpda-Qrt-0.XX
 % make
 % make test
 % make install

After installing the application, at first start, the configuration
directory is initialized automaticaly.  The following command will
list all the defined configurations.

 % tpda-qrt -l

After a fresh instalation only a configuration named 'test' exists.
A new configuration (project) can be created like this:

 % tpda-qrt -i <config-name>

Then edit the connection.yml configuration file and replace at least
the database name and host name (see the next chapter for details).

Start the program with:

 % tpda-qrt myconn [-u username -p password]

If no user and/or password and the connection fails, a login dialog
should show, enter the required data and login.

Click on the '+' toolbar button and then on the 'Edit' button, edit
the title, the output file name, (the sheet name is valid only for
Excel type output) and the description.

In the Parameters Tab input a description and a value for a parameter,
for example for a 'employee' table:

'Salary' '100000'

Delete all other description and values on other rows.

Edit the SQL text, example:

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary < value1 AND salary IS NOT NULL;

Save, then select a file output type between 'Calc', 'CSV' or 'Excel'
click on the connect button and than on 'Run'.  A new file, filled
with the appropriate data, should have been created on the 'output' dir.

I'd appreciate feedback from you, if you tried to install and succeeded
or failed, than please, contact me at <stefansbv 'at' users
. sourceforge . net>.  Of course, a more or less detailed explanation
of what you like or dislike would be helpful for the future
development of this project.

Have fun!
