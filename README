TPDA - Query Repository Tool - a wxPerl and PerlTk GUI tool for data
exporting and query repository management. SQL queries are saved in XML
files and can be edited and parametrized.

Currently supported export formats: CSV, Excel, OpenOffice Calc and ODF.
Database management systems support: Firebird, PostgreSQL, MySQL and
SQLite.

The 'Makefile.PL' script lists the required modules.  From that list
'DBD::SQLite' is required for the tests and for the initial demo
configuration.  The other DBD modules are optional, use only the
needed ones.  Same is true for the modules used to generate the
output, like 'Spreadsheet::WriteExcel', 'OpenOffice::OODoc',
ODF::lpOD, and 'Text::CSV_XS'.

Note: Starting with v0.11, back to 'tpda-qrt' name for the starter
script, using 'qrt' in the initial release, was a bad choice, I think.
I hope no harm was done for those, who tried to test and install the
application.
