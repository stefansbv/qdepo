TPDA - Query Repository Tool - a wxPerl GUI tool for data exporting
and query repository management. Queries are saved in XML files and
can be edited and parametrized.

Currently supported export formats: CSV, Excel, OpenOffice Calc.
Database management systems support: Firebird, PostgreSQL, MySQL and
SQLite.

The idea for this project, was born from the necessity to run, monthly,
the same queries against two small databases, with a couple of
parameters changed at every run, and get the data in spreadsheet
format for further processing.


IMPORTANT NOTE

With version 0.11, back to 'tpda-qrt' name for the
starter script, using 'qrt' in the initial release, was a bad choice,
I think, because it looks like there are some other applications out
there with this name.  I hope no harm was done for those, who
installed the application.

The implementation of the MVC pattern is (heavily) based on the
implementation from the Cipres project:
