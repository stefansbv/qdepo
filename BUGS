* LIMITATION

To find out how many rows would be retrieved, the SQL SELECT statement
is transformed from something like:

SELECT *
FROM table

to:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table

using a simple regexp, everyting after the FROM keyword is captured
and used to made a SELECT COUNT statement.  This work well for simple
SQL SELECT statements but will fail for one that use SELECT FROM
(SELECT from )...


* BUG

White frame in Windows XP if database server is not available.


* BUG

SOLVED:

Segmentation fault on exit after an output generation with progress
dialog.

It' interesting that if we quit the app after another output
generation, without a progress dialog, then is NO Segmentation fault.

Added a '$self->{dialog} = undef' statement in DESTROY!

:D
