* BUG

White frame in Windows XP if database server is not available.


* BUG

SOLVED:

Segmentation fault on exit after an output generation with progress
dialog.

It' interesting that if we quit the app after another output
generation, without a progress dialog, then is NO Segmentation fault.

Added a '$self->{dialog} = undef' statement in DESTROY!

:D
